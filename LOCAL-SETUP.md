# 👷🏻‍♀️ Local Setup

In this file I will keep track of different configurations I have on my dev laptop.  Usually these types of things are the ones you do only once and when you have to do it again you would probably have to Google 🤦🏻‍♀️.  Hence I thought it might be easier to keep things consolidated here.


## 📝 Terminal prompt

I like to personalize my prompt terminal with emojis and with my name.  I am using a MacBook Pro hence the shell used is `zshrc`.  The following is what I have on my `~/.zshrc` file:

```PROMPT='%F{green}valeriemaite%f%F{magenta}%f 💙💎✝️   %F{magenta}%B%~%b%f %# '```
